# Titanic Machine Learning Competition - README

## Overview
This project is a submission to the legendary Titanic Machine Learning competition on Kaggle. The goal of the competition is to use machine learning techniques to predict which passengers survived the tragic sinking of the RMS Titanic.

## Project Objective
The primary objective of this project is to build a predictive model that answers the question: "What sorts of people were more likely to survive?" This is achieved by analyzing passenger data such as name, age, gender, and socio-economic class.

## Dataset Description
The competition provides two datasets:
1. **train.csv**: Used to train the predictive model. This dataset contains information on 891 passengers, including whether they survived (labelled as 1 for survived and 0 for deceased).
2. **test.csv**: Used for generating predictions. This dataset contains information on 418 passengers, with the target variable (Survived) missing.

The provided submission file (`output.csv`) adheres to the following requirements:
- Contains exactly 418 entries (matching the number of passengers in the test dataset).
- Includes a header row.
- Contains two columns:
  - `PassengerId`: Passenger IDs from the test dataset.
  - `Survived`: Binary predictions (1 for survived, 0 for deceased).

## Steps Taken
1. **Data Exploration**:
   - Examined the training dataset to identify patterns and relationships between features (e.g., age, gender, class) and survival outcomes.
   - Visualized data for better understanding.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handled missing values (e.g., filled missing ages and embarked locations).
   - Encoded categorical variables (e.g., gender, class).

3. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Created new features to capture additional patterns (e.g., family size, title extraction from names).
   
4. **Model Building**:
   - Used machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
   - Tuned hyperparameters to optimize performance.

5. **Evaluation**:
   - Assessed model performance using cross-validation and metrics like accuracy and F1-score.
   - Selected the best-performing model for final predictions.

6. **Prediction Submission**:
   - Generated predictions for the test dataset.
   - Saved predictions in the `output.csv` file for submission to Kaggle.

## File Details
### `output.csv`
This file contains the final predictions for the test dataset. It meets Kaggle's submission requirements with the following structure:
```
PassengerId,Survived
892,0
893,1
...
1309,1
```

### Other Relevant Files
- **train.csv**: The training dataset used to build and validate the model.
- **test.csv**: The dataset used to generate predictions.
- **notebook.ipynb**: The Jupyter Notebook containing the full analysis, preprocessing steps, and model implementation.

## Results and Insights
- Survival rates were strongly influenced by factors such as:
  - **Gender**: Women had a higher survival rate than men.
  - **Class**: First-class passengers were more likely to survive than second and third-class passengers.
  - **Age**: Younger passengers had a higher likelihood of survival.
- The best model achieved a cross-validated accuracy of ~80%.

## Instructions for Use
1. Clone the repository containing this project.
2. Place the `train.csv` and `test.csv` files in the data directory.
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook to see the analysis and generate predictions.
4. Submit the `output.csv` file to Kaggle.

## Future Improvements
- Explore more advanced feature engineering techniques.
- Use ensemble methods for improved performance.
- Experiment with neural networks for potentially better predictions.
